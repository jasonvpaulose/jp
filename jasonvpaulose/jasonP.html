        <h2>Where I've been</h2>
        <h4>Education</h4>
        <p>
            I graduated from Georgia Tech with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering in 2019.
            Studying engineering definitely pushed me out of my comfort zone to learn
            new things and work with people from all demographics. I did everything from 
            filling up white boards with Thermodynamics problems to getting my hands
            dirty in the woodshop, but surprisingly, my exposure to programming left a significant mark on me.
            I always enjoyed solving problems and creating through computer science, 
            and fast forward to my professional career, it's continued to shape my goals.
        </p>
        <h4>Career</h4>
        <p>
            I joined Capgemini in June 2019, and it really has been a rewarding experience.
            In my first project, I got to take on different roles from application support,
            creating interactive dashboards, and even designing a mobile app. I didn't expect
            to wear so many different hats, but there's no doubt that having a diverse experience
            helped me realize my interest in creating with technology, and I'm looking forward
            to exploring even further!
        </p>

        <h2>Where I'm Going</h2>
        <h4>Coding Projects</h4>
        <p>Personal projects are one of the best creative outlets, and it really all starts
            with this website! My hope is to share what I'm up to with anyone who&apos;s 
            interested and as a self-driver to always explore and improve.
        </p>
        <h4>Data Visualization</h4>
        <p>
            While programming has huge utility and self-fulfillment, it's also great to use 
            some of the tools out there to help you get started on a project. Feel free to look 
            through some of the data viz's I've learned to make with Tableau!

        <h2>More About Me</h2>
        <h4>Running</h4>
        <p> Similar to a lot of people during the 2020 quarantine, I decided 
            to take up running as hobby. Since then, Im glad to say that I've
            really enjoyed going out for some fresh air and hard work out.
            Here are some of the runs I have scheduled for the week.
