        <h2>Where I've been</h2>
            <h4>Education</h4>
            <p>
                I graduated from Georgia Tech with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering in 2019.
                Studying engineering definitely pushed me out of my comfort zone to learn
                new things and work with people from all demographics. I did everything from 
                filling up white boards with Thermodynamics problems to getting my hands
                dirty in the woodshop, but surprisingly, my exposure to programming left a significant mark on me.
                I always enjoyed solving problems and creating through computer science, 
                and fast forward to my professional career, it's continued to shape my goals.
            </p>
            <h4>Career</h4>
            <p>
                I joined Capgemini in June 2019, and it really has been a rewarding experience.
                In my first project, I got to take on different roles from application support,
                creating interactive dashboards, and even designing a mobile app. I didn't expect
                to wear so many different hats, but there's no doubt that having a diverse experience
                helped me realize my interest in creating with technology, and I'm looking forward
                to exploring even further!
            </p>

            <h2>Where I'm Going</h2>
                <h4>Coding Projects</h4>
                <p>Personal projects are one of the best creative outlets, and it really all starts
                    with this website! My hope is to share what I'm up to with anyone who&apos;s 
                    interested and as a self-driver to always explore and improve.
                </p>
                <h4>Data Visualization</h4>
                <p>
                    While programming has huge utility and self-fulfillment, it's also great to use 
                    some of the tools out there to help you get started on a project. Feel free to look 
                    through some of the data viz's I've learned to make with Tableau!

            <h4>Running</h4>
            <p> Similar to a lot of people during the 2020 quarantine, I decided 
                to take up running as hobby. Since then, Im glad to say that I've
                really enjoyed going out for some fresh air and hard work out.
                Here are some of the runs I have scheduled for the week.
